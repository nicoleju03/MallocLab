I designed a memory allocator using an explicit free list (with a linked list for the free blocks). I wrote functions to initialize the heap, allocate memory, and free memory. Each block has a 4-byte header and footer for the size and allocation status. Free blocks have next and previous pointers (8 bytes each) holding the addresses of their successors and predecessors in the free list. Thus, the minimum block size is 24 bytes (4+8+8+4). I used a first-fit search when searching the free list for a block to allocate data, and placed the most recently freed blocks at the front of the list. I also implemented coalescing and splitting to optimize memory utilization. I defined macros to make the pointer arithmetic easier to manage (for instance, I had macros that would return the address of the adjacent blocks as well as the next and prev free blocks in the free list).
