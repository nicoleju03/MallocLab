# MallocLab I designed a memory allocator using an explicit free list (with a linked list for the free blocks, available to be allocated). Each block had a 4-byte header and footer, and free blocks had next and previous pointers (8 bytes each). The minimum block size was 24 bytes. I used a first-fit search when searching the free list and placed the most recently freed blocks at the front of the list. I also implemented coalescing and splitting to optimize memory utilization.
